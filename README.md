The basic aim of this module is to pull data from a CSV and dump them into MongoDB.
I have used Node.Js and the mongoose, fast-csv, moment packages to build the environment.

This module ingests a csv, cleans the invalid data, transforms and loads into a mongoDb.
Although this is a working model, I look forward to optimizing it better!
